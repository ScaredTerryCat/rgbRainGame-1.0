This is a simple game i programmed in python.There is rgb rain,if upon the player falls blue rain,it becomes blue and it's score +=1.
Red,player becomes red and it's health-=1.
Green,player becomes green and it's health+=1
The games becomes faster and harder as the score get's bigger and the proportion of red rain to green becomes larger and larger.
Enjoy!

ToDO:add music
PS.Credit to chatGpt for generating the playAgain function,even if i needed to modify it a little.
It is more fun to code things myself,but in this case the project took like three days with three days break from each other.
Practically i just needed to reset the values of the variables to reset the game to it's initial state,but i did not know what where their name anymore lol
They were also scattered between my functions ,so it was messy
That is where chatGpt helped me ;)
